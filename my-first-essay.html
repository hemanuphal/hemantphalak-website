        <h1>The First Three Years: What I Learned Building a Company from Zero to One</h1>
        <p class="essay-meta">Published: October 26, 2023</p>

        <p>
            This is where your story begins. Start with the moment you decided to build something. What was the problem you were obsessed with? Be honest, be vulnerable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Talk about the YC application. The interview. The feeling of getting in. This is a huge "high" that many people dream of. Describe it. What did it feel like? What were your expectations?
        </p>

        <h2>The Trough of Sorrow is Real</h2>
        <p>
            This is where you share the "lows". Don't just say "it was hard." Give a specific anecdote. A time when a co-founder disagreement felt like the end of the world. A time when you had 3 months of runway left and no new funding in sight. A story about a painful product failure or losing a key customer.
        </p>
        <p>
            These stories are what build connection and trust with your reader. They show you're not just a success story; you're a human who has struggled.
        </p>

        <h2>Pivotal Moments</h2>
        <p>
            Describe a "high." The moment you got your first paying customer. The day a key metric finally started to go up and to the right. The hire that changed the company's trajectory. Again, be specific. Who was the customer? What was the metric? Who was the hire?
        </p>

        <h2>Lessons for My Younger Self</h2>
        <p>
            Conclude with actionable, hard-won advice. If you could go back to the start, what would you tell yourself? Frame these as lessons for the young entrepreneurs reading your work.
        </p>
