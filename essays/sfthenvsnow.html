        <h1>First time in SF vs full time in SF!</h1>

            <p>I still remember when we got our Y Combinator confirmation, I got my US visa approved in just 7 days. I picked up my passport from the Delhi embassy and boarded a flight that night.</p>
          
            <p><strong>2 years later -</strong></p>
          
            <p>Now, back in SF, meeting founders, customers and building a team here. So many things have changed, but I'm struck by how the city's competitive energy still fuels me.</p>
          
            <p><strong>What stands out most after being away?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The power of compounding opportunities in SF.</li>
              <li>A growing trend of Indian founders relocating to SF.</li>
              <li>The rapid pace of AI advancements—being where the action is makes all the difference in capitalizing on it.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>In most places, saying you want to transform an entire industry raises eyebrows.</p>
          
            <p>Here, it's the starting point of conversation. Being surrounded by this energy recalibrates what you believe is possible.</p>
          
            <p>If you are a founder, you should surely come here once. It is not necessarily about building something here but just meeting people. It can change many things.</p>
          
            <p>If you are in SF, I would love to reconnect with fellow founders, especially anyone working in regulatory tech or healthcare compliance.</p>
