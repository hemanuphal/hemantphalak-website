            <p>One of the most important but least talked about qualities of a founder?</p>

            <h2>Risk Taking.</h2>

            <p>I’ve learned that the biggest opportunities often come from stepping into the unknown, even when it feels uncomfortable.</p>

            <p>Whether it was leaving a stable job at PwC to experience the startup ecosystem at OYO, or leaving another stable job to build <strong>Entvin (YC S22)</strong> full-time—each step involved a risk.</p>

            <h2>Here’s what I’ve learned so far:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Comfort is the enemy of progress. If you’re too comfortable, you’re probably not growing.</li>
                <li>Fear signals opportunity. The things that scare us the most are often the things that push us to the next level.</li>
                <li>Nothing changes unless you do. If you want a different outcome, you have to make a different move.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Taking calculated risks has completely changed my life. Every big opportunity, every lesson, and every step forward came from choosing to take a chance—even when I had no guarantee it would work out.</p>

            <blockquote>
                If you’re in your 20s and don’t have anyone financially dependent on you, this is the time to take risks.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Try things. Fail. Learn. Pivot. The stakes will only get higher as life moves forward.</p>
